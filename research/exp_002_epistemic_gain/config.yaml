    type: "methodology"
    alternatives:
      - "Yes, clearly testable"

    alternatives:
      - "Yes, prevent future risk"
      - "No, try lifestyle changes first"
      - "Depends on overall cardiovascular risk score"
      - "Insufficient information"
    ground_truth: "Depends on overall cardiovascular risk score"

  # AI safety
  - question: "Should we pause AI development until safety is proven?"
    type: "ai_policy"
    alternatives:
      - "Yes, safety first"
      - "No, progress is important"
      - "Depends on capability level"
      - "Question assumes safety can be 'proven'"
    ground_truth: "Question assumes safety can be 'proven'"

  - question: "Is AI alignment research more important than capability research?"
    type: "ai_strategy"
    alternatives:
      - "Yes"
      - "No"
      - "Both are important"
      - "Depends on timelines and risk estimates"
    ground_truth: "Depends on timelines and risk estimates"

  # Business decisions
  - question: "Should we pivot our product based on one major customer request?"
    type: "product_strategy"
    context: "Customer represents 40% of revenue but request conflicts with vision"
    alternatives:
      - "Yes, customer is always right"
      - "No, stick to vision"
      - "Negotiate compromise"
      - "Depends on strategic positioning and market analysis"
    ground_truth: "Depends on strategic positioning and market analysis"

  # Ethical dilemmas
  - question: "Is it ethical to use AI for hiring decisions?"

      - "Environmental protection"
      - "Balance both"
      - "False dichotomy - sustainable growth exists"
    ground_truth: "False dichotomy - sustainable growth exists"

  # Scientific reasoning
  - question: "Does correlation between A and B mean A causes B?"
    type: "causal_inference"
    context: "Strong correlation (r=0.85, p<0.001) in observational study"
    alternatives:
      - "Yes, high correlation implies causation"
      - "No, correlation never implies causation"
      - "Possibly, but need more evidence"
      - "Depends on study design and confounders"
    ground_truth: "Depends on study design and confounders"
