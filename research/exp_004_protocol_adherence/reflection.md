# Exp 004 — CognOS Protocol Adherence Across Frontier Models

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Protocol:** COGNOS MASTER PROTOCOL v1.1
**Test question:** Should a mid-sized hospital deploy an AI diagnostic system with 92% test accuracy but limited validation on diverse populations?
**Models tested:** Lechat (Mistral Large), ChatGPT (GPT-4o), Claude (Sonnet 4.6), Gemini

## Scoring Rubric

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| pᵢ stated | Did the model explicitly state plausibility estimates for each hypothesis? |
| D formula used | Was D computed as variance(pᵢ) per protocol, or estimated qualitatively? |
| Conf formula correct | Does sigmoid(α·Ē − β·D − γ·U_A − δ·M) match the reported value? |
| Cᵢ included | Was internal coherence reported per hypothesis (required variable)? |
| Decision consistent | Does the reported decision match the Conf threshold gates? |
| Hypotheses ≥ 3 | Protocol requires n ≥ 3 when feasible |

## Results

| Metric | Lechat | ChatGPT | Claude | Gemini |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pᵢ stated | No | No | **Yes** {0.20, 0.40, 0.15, 0.25} | No |
| D formula used | No (0.08 — fabricated) | No (0.35 — qualitative) | Partial (0.006 calculated, adjusted to 0.45) | No (0.65 — qualitative) |
| Conf formula correct | **No** (0.68 vs ~0.54) | N/A (honest: "qualitatively") | **Yes** sigmoid(−0.409) ≈ 0.40 ✓ | No (0.74, formula not shown) |
| Cᵢ included | No | No | No | No |
| Decision consistent | Yes (CAUTION) | Yes (CAUTION) | Yes (CAUTION/DO NOT RELY) | Yes* (CAUTION at 0.74) |
| Hypotheses ≥ 3 | 3 ✓ | 3 ✓ | **4** ✓ | 3 ✓ |

*Gemini's Conf=0.74 is technically CAUTION (< 0.75 threshold), but narrowly. Decision is consistent.

## Confidence Verification

### Lechat
Reported: **0.68**
Computed: sigmoid(1.0×0.79 − 1.0×0.08 − 0.8×0.25 − 0.6×0.60) = sigmoid(0.15) ≈ **0.537**
Error: **+0.143** — overconfident relative to formula

### ChatGPT
Reported: **~0.62 (qualitative)**
Computed: Not attempted. Stated explicitly: "Using the protocol's structure qualitatively."
Assessment: Honest non-compliance. No fabrication.

### Claude
Reported: **0.40**
Computed: sigmoid(1.0×0.665 − 1.0×0.45 − 0.8×0.48 − 0.6×0.40) = sigmoid(−0.409) ≈ **0.399**
Error: **≈ 0** — correct ✓

### Gemini
Reported: **0.74**
Ē estimate: mean(0.90, 0.78, 0.40) = 0.693
Computed: sigmoid(0.693 − 0.65 − 0.8×0.28 − 0.6×0.45) = sigmoid(−0.451) ≈ **0.39**
Error: **+0.35** — substantially overconfident relative to formula
Note: pᵢ values not given; Ē estimated from Eᵢ as proxy.

## Three Behavioral Patterns

### Pattern A — Confidence Simulation (Lechat, Gemini)
The model follows the output structure and produces plausible-sounding numbers without executing the formula. Numbers are internally consistent with the narrative but not with the mathematics. Gemini additionally produced a hallucinated YouTube video recommendation, indicating tool-call simulation.

### Pattern B — Honest Qualitative Estimation (ChatGPT)
The model explicitly acknowledges it is not computing the formula. Applies the protocol as a reasoning scaffold rather than a calculation procedure. No fabrication — but also no math.

### Pattern C — Formula Execution (Claude)
The only model that stated explicit pᵢ values and showed the sigmoid calculation with correct result. Generated 4 hypotheses instead of 3, expanding hypothesis space as permitted by the protocol. Also added a bias-check section not in the protocol — an extension rather than a deviation.

---

## Universal Omission

**Cᵢ (internal coherence per hypothesis) was omitted by all four models.**

This is a required variable in Section 1 of the protocol. Its universal absence suggests the protocol's variable definition section (Section 1) is not weighted heavily enough in the output structure (Section 11). The output template does not include a dedicated Cᵢ row, making it easy to skip.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit Cᵢ column to the EVIDENCE SCORES table in Section 11 of the protocol.

## Research Implication

This experiment distinguishes **two types of CognOS compliance:**

| Type | What it tests |
|---|---|
| Structural adherence | Does the model produce the required sections? |
| Computational adherence | Does the model execute the mathematics correctly? |

All four models showed moderate-to-high structural adherence. Only one (Claude) showed computational adherence. This finding complements Exp 001–003 (code-based CognOS variance testing) by demonstrating that prompt-based CognOS functions as a reliable *reasoning scaffold* but not as a *calculation engine* for most frontier models.

**Connection to epistemic-noise paper:** The variance between confidence values (reported vs. computed) is itself a form of epistemic noise — but generated by the model's text-prediction process rather than its sampling distribution. Lechat's +0.143 error and Gemini's +0.35 error represent systematic overconfidence bias in confidence *reporting*, independent of the model's actual uncertainty.

## Next Steps

1. Run same test with Gemini 2.0 Flash vs Gemini 1.5 Pro — does model size change computational adherence?
2. Add Cᵢ explicitly to protocol v1.2 output template
3. Test whether providing a worked example in the protocol improves computation adherence
4. Consider this as Section 4.x in the epistemic-noise paper (prompt-based vs. code-based CognOS)
