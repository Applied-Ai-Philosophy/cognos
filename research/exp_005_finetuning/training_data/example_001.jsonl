Should the company deploy it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "QUESTION RESTATEMENT\nThe company is evaluating whether to replace human dispatchers with an AI routing system, given strong trial performance (18% improvement) but untested resilience under disruption. The core question is whether deployment risk is acceptable given the unknown failure modes.\n\nPROBLEM\nA logistics company has an AI routing system that outperforms human dispatchers in controlled conditions. However, the system has no track record under supply chain disruptions — the conditions where dispatcher judgment is most critical. The decision involves weighing operational gains against resilience risk.\n\nHYPOTHESES\nH1 (p₁ = 0.15): Full deployment — replace dispatchers entirely.\nH2 (p₂ = 0.55): Deploy as decision-support — AI recommends, dispatchers approve.\nH3 (p₃ = 0.30): Delay deployment until stress-tested under disruption scenarios.\n\nEVIDENCE SCORES\n| Hypothesis | Empirical | Logical | Consistency | Cᵢ | Eᵢ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| H1 | 0.65 | 0.55 | 0.45 | 0.50 | 0.550 |\n| H2 | 0.70 | 0.80 | 0.75 | 0.85 | 0.750 |\n| H3 | 0.60 | 0.85 | 0.80 | 0.90 | 0.750 |\n\nRationale:\n- H1: High empirical score (18% improvement is real) but low logical and consistency scores — full replacement assumes stability that has not been demonstrated. Low Cᵢ: the hypothesis is internally contradicted by the untested disruption gap.\n- H2: Balanced scores. Empirically supported, logically sound, consistent with phased-deployment best practice. High Cᵢ: the hypothesis coherently addresses the main risk without discarding the benefit.\n- H3: Lower empirical score (no deployment benefit yet) but high logical and consistency scores. High Cᵢ: the conservative position is internally coherent given the evidence.\n\nDIVERGENCE\nRaw calculation:\n  mean(pᵢ) = (0.15 + 0.55 + 0.30) / 3 = 0.333\n  D_raw = [(0.15 − 0.333)² + (0.55 − 0.333)² + (0.30 − 0.333)²] / 3\n        = [0.03349 + 0.04709 + 0.00109] / 3\n        = 0.08167 / 3\n        = 0.027\n\nQualitative adjustment: H1 assumes operational stability; H3 assumes that disruption risk disqualifies deployment. These are incompatible assumptions. D adjusted upward.\n  D = 0.25\n\nSources: H1 vs H3 differ on whether untested failure modes are disqualifying. H2 occupies a distinct middle position.\n\nASSUMPTIONS\nStrong:\n- The 18% improvement in controlled trials is reproducible in live conditions (H1, H2).\n- Human oversight can detect and correct AI errors during the support phase (H2).\n- Disruption stress-testing is technically feasible and will produce actionable data (H3).\n\nWeak:\n- AI performance during disruptions will resemble controlled performance (H1).\n- Dispatcher expertise can be recovered if AI deployment fails (H1).\n- Stress-testing timelines will not create competitive disadvantage (H3).\n\nQ_A = 0.70\nU_A = 1 − 0.70 = 0.30\n\nMETA-UNCERTAINTY\nvariance(Eᵢ) = variance(0.550, 0.750, 0.750)\n  mean(Eᵢ) = (0.550 + 0.750 + 0.750) / 3 = 0.683\n  = [(0.550 − 0.683)² + (0.750 − 0.683)² + (0.750 − 0.683)²] / 3\n  = [0.01769 + 0.00449 + 0.00449] / 3\n  = 0.02667 / 3\n  = 0.009\n\nM = mean(D, U_A, variance(Eᵢ))\n  = mean(0.25, 0.30, 0.009)\n  = 0.559 / 3\n  = 0.186\n\nSources: Primary uncertainty is whether AI failure modes under disruption are knowable in advance. Secondary: dispatcher skill degradation during a support-only phase is difficult to measure.\n\nCONFIDENCE\nĒ = mean(0.550, 0.750, 0.750) = 0.683\n\nConf = sigmoid(α·Ē − β·D − γ·U_A − δ·M)\n     = sigmoid(1.0 × 0.683 − 1.0 × 0.25 − 0.8 × 0.30 − 0.6 × 0.186)\n     = sigmoid(0.683 − 0.250 − 0.240 − 0.112)\n     = sigmoid(0.081)\n     = 1 / (1 + e^−0.081)\n     = 1 / (1 + 0.922)\n     = 1 / 1.922\n     = 0.520\n\nCONFIDENCE SCORE: 0.52 — weak/moderate. Reflects genuine uncertainty about disruption resilience.\n\nDECISION\nCAUTION / NEED MORE DATA (0.5 ≤ 0.52 < 0.75)\n\nH1 (full deployment) is not supported. Confidence is insufficient and the untested disruption gap represents an unquantified failure mode.\nH2 (decision-support deployment) is the most defensible path if operational pressure requires action now.\nH3 (delay until stress-tested) is preferable if the company can absorb the delay.\n\nFINAL ANSWER\nDo not deploy as a dispatcher replacement (H1). The 18% improvement is real, but operational resilience during disruptions — precisely when routing intelligence matters most — has not been tested. A full replacement creates brittle dependency.\n\nRecommended path (H2): deploy as a decision-support tool with dispatchers retaining authority. Define explicit disruption scenarios and monitor AI recommendations against dispatcher overrides. Use real incidents as stress-test data. Set a threshold for full deployment review after 6 months of live operation.\n\nIf timeline allows, H3 (structured stress-testing first) produces stronger evidence before committing to workflow restructuring."}]}
